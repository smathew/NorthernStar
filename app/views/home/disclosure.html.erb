                    <h3>Individual Account</h3>
                    <p>
                        An individual account is an account owned by the depositor
                        including any individual, partnership, or other organization
                        qualified for Credit Union membership. In the event of
                        your death the funds in the account will go to your estate
                        (subject to the terms of this agreement).&nbsp; Alternatively,
                        you can designate a specific person or persons or entity
                        as a beneficiary(s)/POD (payable on death) payee(s) for
                        your individual account.&nbsp; In the event of your death,
                        the beneficiary(s)/POD payee(s) will be entitled to the
                        funds in the account (subject to the terms of this agreement)
                        upon proof&nbsp; of your death and the beneficiary&rsquo;s/POD
                        payee&rsquo;s identification.&nbsp; If you designate
                        more than one beneficiary/POD payee on the account, each
                        will be entitled to his or her (or its) proportionate
                        share of the funds in the account (which will be determined
                        by dividing the amount of the funds in the account by
                        the number of beneficiaries/POD payees designated on
                        the account) and will own those funds without right of
                        survivorship.&nbsp; If a beneficiary/POD payee predeceases
                        you, it is your responsibility to notify us and change
                        the account accordingly.&nbsp;  Beneficiary/POD payee
                        designations made on this contract do not apply to Individual
                        Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or any account life savings
                        insurance, which have separate beneficiary designations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Multiple Party Account</h3>
                    <p>
                        An account owned by two or more individuals is a multiple
                        party or joint account. This account may be with or without
                        survivorship as designated on the Application for Membership.
                        If the account is &ldquo;Joint with Survivorship&rdquo;,
                        upon the death of one of the joint owners that person&rsquo;s
                        interest will become the property of the surviving joint
                        owner(s). If the account is &ldquo;Joint without Survivorship&rdquo;,
                        the interest of the deceased owner will pass to his estate. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rights of Joint Account Owners</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any joint account owner is authorized to act for the
                        other owner(s) and the Credit Union may accept orders
                        and instructions regarding the account, requests for
                        future services and any transaction from any joint owner.
                        Any joint owner may withdraw all funds in the account,
                        stop payment on items drawn on an account, transfer or
                        pledge all or any part of the shares of any account without
                        the consent of the other account owner(s). The Credit
                        Union shall have no duty to notify any other joint account
                        owner(s).<br />
                        The Credit Union reserves the right to require written
                        consent of all joint account owners for a change of ownership
                        or termination of an account. If the Credit Union receives
                        written notice of a dispute between joint account owners
                        or receives inconsistent instructions from them, the
                        Credit Union may suspend or terminate the account, require
                        a court order to act, or require that all joint account
                        owners agree in writing to any transaction concerning
                        the agreement. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Liability of Joint Account Owners</h3>
                    <p>
                        If any item deposited in a joint account is returned
                        unpaid or an account is overdrawn, each of the joint
                        account owners is jointly and severally liable to the
                        Credit Union for the amount of the returned item of overdraft,
                        any resulting charges, regardless of who created the
                        overdraft, deposited or cashed the item or benefited
                        from the transaction. If any joint owner is indebted
                        to the Credit Union such that the Credit Union has a
                        lien against an account of that joint owner, The Credit
                        Union may enforce its rights against any or all funds
                        in the joint account, or the joint owner&rsquo;s other
                        accounts, regardless of who contributed the funds to
                        the account(s). 
                    </p>
                    <h3>POD (Payable on Death)</h3>
                    <p>
                        An account with a POD beneficiary on the Application
                        for Membership means that the account is payable to the
                        owner or owners during their lifetimes, then upon the
                        death of the last surviving joint owner, the funds in
                        the account shall be paid to the designated POD beneficiary.
                        If more than one POD beneficiary is named, the funds
                        will be owned jointly by them. If an account is a multiple
                        party account, each of the owners will be subject to
                        the rules of joint ownership shown above. A POD designation
                        does not apply to individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
                        since they have a separate beneficiary designation. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Account for Minors</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Credit Union will establish an account for a minor
                        child; however, we reserve the right to require a joint
                        owner who is at least 18 years of age and who shall be
                        primarily liable to the Credit Union for any returned
                        item, overdraft, or unpaid charges on the account. The
                        Credit Union shall honor all withdrawals and deposits
                        of the minor without regard to his minority as long as
                        adequate identification is provided. If the parent is
                        not a joint owner, no information will be released to
                        them. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Uniform Transfer to Minors Account</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Credit Union will establish an individual account
                        for a member as custodian who wishes to deposit funds
                        as an irrevocable gift to a minor. There may be only
                        one custodian for each UTMA account. The custodian has
                        control of the account for the benefit of the minor and
                        is the only party entitled to make withdrawals or close
                        the account. The Credit Union has no duty to inquire
                        into the purpose of any withdrawal or use of the funds
                        by the custodian. The appointment of a successor custodian
                        in the event of the custodian&rsquo;s death shall be
                        made in accordance with applicable state law. The age
                        at which a minor reaches majority may also vary from
                        state to state. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Accounts for Member Entities</h3>
                    <p>
                        Entities that qualify for membership can open and own
                        a one owner account, and both the entity and its designated
                        signers are subject to the terms, responsibilities and
                        liabilities of this contract.&nbsp; We may require any
                        signer to provide proper evidence of the entity&rsquo;s
                        existence (e.g., articles of incorporation, partnership
                        agreement, business license), and to establish his or
                        her authority to act as a signer (e.g., through a notarized
                        board resolution, partnership letter, etc.) and his or
                        her identity as a signer prior to opening the account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each director, officer, partner, shareholder, employee,
                        member, trustee, agent, signer, etc., promises that the
                        entity has been legally formed and exist, that it qualifies
                        for membership, and all signers promise that they hold
                        the position/titles as provided on this contract and
                        have the authority to transact business on behalf of

                        employees, members, trustees, agents and signers agree
                        to the terms, responsibilities and liabilities of this
                        contract (and the agreement, all disclosures, bylaws,
                        policies and procedures incorporated by reference), and
                        further agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless
                        for any loss, damage, claim or liability that occurs
                        as a result of opening, maintaining, conducting transactions
                        on and closing the account.&nbsp; We reserve the right
                        to require that all checks made payable to an entity
                        be deposited to the entity&rsquo;s account.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Power of Attorney</h3>
                    <p>

                        will be retained and the expiration date noted on the

                        in writing prior to the expiration date and fails to
                        act on it, we will not be liable for any transactions
                        performed up to that date. &nbsp;Additionally, if we

                        of attorney.&nbsp;

                        All items of Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers
                        credited to your account are provisional until we receive
                        final payment. If final payment is not received, we may
                        charge your account for the amount of such items or ACH
                        transfers and impose a return item charge on your account.
                        Any collection fees we incur will be charged to your
                        account. We reserve the right to refuse or return any
                        item or funds transfer.

                    <h3>Direct Deposits</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may offer preauthorized deposits (e.g., payroll checks,
                        Social Security, or retirement checks, or other government
                        checks) or preauthorized transfers from other accounts.
                        You must authorize each direct deposit or preauthorized
                        transfers from other accounts. You must authorize each
                        direct deposit or preauthorized transfer by filing out
                        a separate form. You must notify us at least thirty (30)
                        days in advance to cancel or change a direct deposit
                        or transfer option. Upon a bankruptcy filing, unless
                        you cancel an authorization, we will continue making
                        direct deposits in accordance with your authorization
                        on file with us. If we are required to reimburse the
                        U. S. Government for any benefit payment directly deposited
                        into your account, we may deduct the amount returned
                        from any of your accounts, unless prohibited by law. 
                    </p>

                        No more than six transfers and withdrawals or a combination
                        of the two may be made from a savings account to another

                        <hr />
                    <p>Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Federal
                        Reserve&rsquo;s Regulation J cover the movement of funds
                        by means of wire transfers, automated clearinghouse (ACH)
                        credit and some inter-account transfers on the Credit
                        Union&rsquo;s records.&nbsp; Using the Credit Union to
                        send or receive funds transfers will constitute your
                        acceptance of these terms of agreement. <br />
                        The Credit Union may charge your account for the amount
                        of any funds transfer initiated by you or by any person
                        authorized by you as a joint owner or other authorized
                        party with the right of access to the account from which
                        the funds transfer is to be made.<br />
                        The Credit Union may establish, from time to time, security
                        procedures to verify the authenticity of a payment order.&nbsp;  You
                        will be notified of the security procedures, if any are
                        to be used to verify payment orders issued by you or
                        for which your account will be liable.&nbsp; You agree
                        that the authenticity of payment orders may be verified
                        using that security procedure unless you notify the Credit
                        Union in writing that you do not agree with that security
                        procedure.&nbsp; In that event, the Credit Union shall
                        have no obligation to accept any payment order form you
                        or other authorized parties on the account until you
                        and the Credit Union agree, in writing, on an alternate
                        security procedure.<br />
                        If you send or receive a wire transfer, Fedwire may be
                        used.&nbsp; These transactions are governed by Regulation
                        J.&nbsp; You will receive notice of such transfers on
                        your periodic account statement.&nbsp; If you give the
                        Credit Union a payment order which identifies the beneficiary
                        (person who will receive the funds) by both name and
                        identifying or account number, payment may be made to
                        the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank on the basis of the identifying
                        or account number, even if the number identifies a person
                        different than the named beneficiary.&nbsp; If you give
                        the Credit Union a payment order which identifies any
                        bank in the funds transfer by name and by a routing/transit
                        or other identifying number, the Credit Union can rely
                        on the number even if it identifies a bank different
                        form the named bank.<br />
                        Unless otherwise provided by the Credit Union in a separate
                        schedule concerning specific types of funds transfers,
                        the cut-off time for receipt and processing of payment
                        orders shall be 4 p.m. EST (EDT) on each funds transfer
                        business day (Monday-Friday). Payment orders received
                        after the cut off time may not be transmitted until the
                        following business day. <br />
                        ACH transactions are governed by the operating rules
                        of the National Automated Clearing House Association.&nbsp; In
                        accordance with these rules the Credit Union will not
                        provide you with next day notice of receipt of ACH credit
                        transfers to your account.&nbsp; We will provide information
                        about these transactions on your periodic statement or
                        you may contact the Credit Union to verify receipt of
                        ACH debits or credits.<br />
                        The Credit Union may give you credit for ACH payments
                        before it receives final settlement of the funds transfer.&nbsp; Any
                        such credit is provisional until the Credit Union receives
                        final settlement on the payment.&nbsp; You are hereby
                        notified and agree, if the Credit Union does not receive
                        such final settlement, that it is entitled to a refund
                        from you of the amount credited to you in connection
                        with that ACH entry.&nbsp; This means that the Credit
                        Union may provide you with access to ACH funds before
                        the Credit Union actually receives the money. However,
                        if the Credit Union does not receive the money, then
                        the Credit Union may reverse the entry on your account
                        and you would be liable to repay the Credit Union.

                    <h3>Nature of Dividends.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dividends are paid form current income and available earnings after
                        required transfers to reserves at the end of the dividend
                        period.</p>
                    <h3>Compounding and Crediting.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dividends will be compounded quarterly and credited to your account
                        quarterly.&nbsp; The dividend period is quarterly for
                        all savings accounts.</p>

                    <p>
                        If the beginning date of the first dividend period of the
                        calendar year is January 1, the ending date of such period
                        is March 31.</p>
                    <h3>Monthly Dividend Period.</h3> 
                    <p>
                        If the beginning date of the first dividend period of the
                        calendar year is January 1, the ending date of such period
                        is January 31.&nbsp; The dividend posting date follows
                        the ending date of a dividend period.&nbsp; For the quarterly
                        dividend period ending on March 31, the declaration date
                        would be April 1.&nbsp; For the first monthly dividend
                        period of a calendar year, the declaration date would
                        be February 1.&nbsp; If you close an account before dividends
                        are credited you will receive accrued dividends.

                        The minimum balance required to open a savings/checking accounts
                        are reflected on the Rate Schedule.&nbsp; The minimum
                        average daily balances required to obtain the annual
                        percentage yield (APY) disclosed are also reflected on

                    <h3>Fees.</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Fees, which may be
                        assessed on your account, are reflected on the Rate and

                    <h3>Balance Computation Method.</h3> 
                    <p>
                        We use the average daily balance method to calculate dividends
                        and for obtaining the APY on your account.&nbsp; This
                        method applies a periodic rate to the average daily balance
                        in your account for the dividend period.&nbsp; The average
                        daily balance is calculated by adding the balance in
                        the account each day in the dividend period and dividing
                        that figure by the number of days in the dividend period.

                    <h3>Accrual of Dividends.</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Dividends begin to accrue on the business day you deposit items
                        to your account unless otherwise disclosed to you at
                        the time of deposit.

                        The Credit Union is only required to permit a withdrawal
                        if you have sufficient funds available in your account
                        or you have an established overdraft protection plan.&nbsp; There
                        are no transaction limitations on checking accounts as
                        long as there are sufficient funds or you have an established
                        overdraft protection plan.&nbsp; Certain transaction
                        limitations may apply to an IRA (Individual Retirement

                        The Rate and Fee Schedule,
                        reflects the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on your share certificate
                        account that will be paid until maturity.&nbsp; The annual percentage yield
                        assumes dividends will remain on deposit until maturity.&nbsp; A withdrawal
                        of dividends will reduce earnings.

                    <h3>Compounding and Crediting.</h3>

                        You must select a dividend distribution option at the time the certificate is
                        purchased.&nbsp; You may elect dividends to be compounded and credited quarterly.&nbsp; Or
                        instead of compounding, the dividends can be mailed to you quarterly in the
                        form of a check or transferred to a specific account quarterly.

                        sufficient to cover all checks written and all debits
                        initiated against an account.&nbsp; Repeated overdrafts
                        may result in your account being closed.&nbsp; In addition,
                        you agree to the terms herein, which the Credit Union
                        may supplement and amend from time to time and to applicable

                        be liable for failure to pay a check unless such failure

                        If a check is written or an electronic check is presented for an amount in excess of the
                        balance in your checking account and there is no established overdraft protection
                        plan, the check will be returned and you will be charged as indicated on
                        the Rate and Fee Schedule. You may request to have funds transferred from
                        your savings account if your checking account does not have sufficient funds;
                        however, only funds in excess of the $25 required to maintain your prime
                        share account will be available for transfer.&nbsp; (There is a limitation

                        Account Access for details.)<br />
                        If you or any of your joint owners has an overdraft line
                        of credit agreement with the Credit Union, a check written
                        for funds in excess of the balance in your checking account
                        will constitute a request for an advance from the line
                        of credit.&nbsp; Such advances will be made in increments
                        of $50.00.&nbsp; If less than $50.00 is available on
                        the line of credit, the amount available will be transferred.&nbsp; The
                        Credit Union may make the advance and add the amount

                        for payment before its date, the Credit Union may return it unpaid.<br />
                        The Credit Union may, but is under no obligation to pay
                        a check drawn on your account, which is presented more
                        than six months after its date.

                        may request a stop payment in person or via facsimile with signature.&nbsp; The
                        stop payment will be effective if we receive the notice in time to act upon
                        it and you provide the number of the account, date and number of the check,
                        its exact amount, and to whom it was issued.&nbsp; If you give the Credit
                        Union incorrect or incomplete information, we will not be responsible for
                        failing to stop payment on the check.&nbsp; If the stop payment is not received
                        in time for the Credit Union to act upon the order, we will not be liable
                        to you or to any other party for payment of the check.&nbsp; If we re-credit&nbsp;your
                        account after paying a check over a valid and timely stop payment order,
                        you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to transfer
                        to the Credit Union all of your rights against the payee or other holders
                        of the check, and to assist the Credit Union in legal action taken against

                        Written stop payment orders are effective for six months.&nbsp; In
                        order for any written stop payment order to remain in
                        effect after the initial six months, you must renew the
                        order in writing.&nbsp;  The Credit Union is not obligated
                        to notify you when a stop payment order expires.<br />
                        The Credit Union will charge you a fee for each stop

                        check, or any other check or payment guaranteed by you
                        or the Credit Union.&nbsp; You should know that while
                        payment of a check may be stopped, you may remain liable
                        to any person, including the Credit Union, who is a holder
                        of the check despite the stop payment order.&nbsp; You
                        agree to indemnify and hold the Credit Union harmless
                        from all costs, including attorney&rsquo;s fees, damages

                        in refusing payment of a check, including claims of any
                        multiple party account owner, payee, or endorsee in failing
                        to stop payment of a check as a result of incorrect information

                        system.&nbsp; You must authorize these debits with the
                        originator (a company or organization).&nbsp; The originator
                        is responsible for giving a copy of the authorization
                        to you and for keeping a copy of your authorization on
                        file.&nbsp; Since these debits are normally directed
                        to your checking account, some rules are the same as
                        for written checks.

                        funds in excess of the balance in your checking account
                        will constitute a request for an advance from the line

                        Upon opening an account, you must provide a name, a matching
                        Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and a valid address.&nbsp; You
                        must also certify that you are subject to, are not subject
                        to, or are exempt from backup withholding under Section
                        3406(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; If
                        your account is or becomes subject to backup withholding,
                        the Credit Union is required by law to withhold and pay
                        to the Internal Revenue Service a percentage of paid
                        dividends and certain other payments under certain conditions.&nbsp; Your
                        failure to furnish a correct TIN or meet other applicable
                        requirements may result in backup withholding as well
                        as civil or criminal penalties.

                    <h3>&nbsp;Credit Union Lien and Security Interest </h3>
                    <p>
                        Northern Star Credit Union may use the funds from you
                        shares and dividends to pay any debt or amount you owe
                        to the Credit Union.&nbsp; Further as a borrower, guarantor,
                        endorser, or otherwise, we have a statutory lien on the
                        funds in any account which you have an ownership interest,
                        regardless of the source, unless prohibited by law.&nbsp; We
                        may apply these funds, without further notice to you
                        in order to pay off the indebtedness.&nbsp; By not enforcing
                        the lien, the Credit Union does not waive its right to
                        enforce it later.&nbsp; In addition, you grant the Credit
                        Union a consensual security interest in your accounts
                        and we may use the funds from your accounts to pay any
                        debt or any amount now or hereafter owed the Credit Union,
                        except for obligations secured by your residence, unless
                        prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp; All accounts are
                        non-assignable and nontransferable to third parties. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>&nbsp;Legal Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        If any legal action is brought against your account, we
                        may pay out funds according to the terms of the action
                        or refuse any payout until the dispute is resolved.&nbsp; Expenses
                        or attorneys fees we incur may be charged to your account
                        without notice to you, unless prohibited by law.&nbsp; Any
                        legal process against your account is subject to our
                        lien and statutory interest. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If any and all charges, losses , and/or negative balances
                        in the account are not paid when due, the member(s) agree
                        to pay all costs of collection including an attorney&rsquo;s
                        fee of 33 1/3% of&nbsp; the balance placed with the attorney,
                        which shall be deemed incurred upon referral for collection,
                        plus applicable legal or contractual rate of interest.

                    <h3>&nbsp;Statements of Account </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Credit Union will provide periodic statements depending
                        upon the type of activity in your account.&nbsp;  You
                        will get a monthly statement if you have a checking account
                        or if you have any electronic funds transfers during
                        that month.&nbsp; If you have signed up for services
                        that provide electronic access to your account (ATM,
                        check card, home banking, audio response) but there has
                        been no account activity for 6 months, your electronic
                        privileges may be revoked and you will receive statements
                        on an annual basis.&nbsp; In any event you will receive
                        a statement at least annually if we have your current
                        address on file. <br />
                        It is your responsibility to review the statement within
                        a &ldquo;reasonable amount of time&rdquo; and notify
                        the Credit Union immediately if you discover any unauthorized
                        transactions or alternations.&nbsp; If you fail to do
                        this, you may bear the entire loss yourself (depending
                        on whether we exercised ordinary care and, if not, whether
                        we substantially contributed to the loss).&nbsp; A &ldquo;reasonable
                        amount of time&rdquo;  will generally be within 30 days
                        after the statement was mailed to you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Termination of Account </h3>
                    <p>

                        outstanding obligations.&nbsp; It may also require you
                        to close your account and apply for a new account.&nbsp; Circumstances
                        for these actions may include, but are not limited to:

                        terminate the account.&nbsp; We are not responsible for
                        payment of any draft, withdrawal, or other item after

                    <p>
                        If you have not made any deposits, withdrawals or other
                        transactions or communicated with us in writing regarding
                        your account during a 12-month period, your account will
                        be classified as &ldquo;inactive&rdquo;.&nbsp; Dividend
                        postings will not be considered transactions for this
                        purpose.&nbsp; We have the right to request additional
                        identification and written authorization for transactions
                        on inactive accounts.&nbsp; If your account remains inactive
                        for an extended period of time, it will be considered
                        abandoned.&nbsp; In accordance with state unclaimed property
                        acts, funds in abandoned accounts must be remitted to

                    <h3>Your Ability to Withdraw Funds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our normal policy is to make funds from deposits to your
                        checking account at Northern Star branches available
                        to you immediately.&nbsp; A hold may be placed on
                        any type of deposit made at shared branch facilities
                        or ATM&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Electronic direct deposits
                        will be available on the day we receive the deposit.&nbsp; Once
                        they are available, you can withdraw funds in cash,
                        and/or we will use the funds to pay checks that you
                        have written.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                        For determining the availability of your deposits, every
                        day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays and Federal
                        Holidays.&nbsp;  If you make a deposit before regular
                        business hours on a business day that we are open, we
                        will consider that day to be the day of your deposit.&nbsp;  However,
                        if you make a deposit after regular business hours or
                        on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit
                        was made on the next business day we are open.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Longer Delays May Apply:</h3> 
                    <p>
                        In some cases, we may not make all the funds that you deposit by check 
                        available to you immediately.&nbsp; Depending
                        on the type of deposit, funds may not be available between two and nine business
                        day after the day of your deposit.&nbsp; However, the first $100 of your
                        deposit will be made available to you within 24 hours.<br />
                        If we are not going to make all the funds from your deposit
                        available, we will notify you at the time you make the
                        deposit.&nbsp; We will also tell you when the funds will
                        be available.&nbsp; If your deposit is not made directly
                        to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this
                        action after you have left the premises, we will mail
                        you the notice by the business day after we receive your
                        deposit.<br />
                        If you will need the funds from a deposit immediately,
                        you should ask us when the funds will be available.<br />
                        In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed
                        for a longer period under the following circumstances:

                        We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw
                        funds for any of these reasons and we will tell you when
                        the funds will be available.&nbsp; They will generally
                        be available no later than the 9th business day after
                        the day of your deposit.<br />
                        If we cash a check for you that is drawn on another bank,
                        we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount
                        of funds that are already in your account.&nbsp; Those
                        funds will be available at the time funds from the check
                        we cashed would have been available if you had deposited
                        it.

                        This disclosure is made to comply with the requirements
                        of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Federal Reserve
                        Regulation E, and VISA Operating Rules.&nbsp; This law
                        establishes the basic rights, liabilities and responsibilities
                        of consumers who use electronic fund transfer services
                        and of the financial institutions providing such services.&nbsp; If
                        you use automated teller machines on any network in which
                        the Credit Union participates, or if you use any preauthorized

                        apply to you.&nbsp;  Additionally, the information provided

                    <h3>Your liability for unauthorized transactions:</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Credit Union ATM card,
                        audio response or home banking PIN has been lost, stolen
                        or used or may be used without your authority.&nbsp;  Telephoning
                        the Credit Union is the best way of keeping your possible
                        losses down, although you may tell us in person, in writing
                        or by electronic mail at the address in this disclosure.&nbsp; You
                        could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum
                        revolving line of credit).<br />
                        You will have no liability for unauthorized use of your
                        check card or account information when the transaction
                        is processed through the VISA network unless the card
                        was handled negligently.<br />
                        If your ATM card or check card is lost or stolen or used
                        without your authorization at an ATM or point of sales
                        device with a PIN you must tell us within 2 business
                        days after you learn of the loss, theft or unauthorized
                        use of your card or PIN. If we can prove we could have
                        stopped someone from using your card or PIN without your
                        permission if you had told us, you could lose all funds
                        in your account.&nbsp; These same rules apply to your
                        audio response or home banking PIN.<br />
                        Also, if your statement shows an electronic funds transfer
                        that you did not make or authorize anyone to make, tell
                        us at once.&nbsp; If you do not tell us within 60 days
                        after the first statement which reflected the unauthorized
                        transfer was mailed to you, you may not get back any
                        money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that
                        we could have stopped someone from taking the money if
                        you had told us in time.

                        Northern Star Credit Union Inc. enables Non-Visa Debit
                        Transactions processing and does not require that a PIN
                        authenticate all such transactions.&nbsp;  A Non-Visa
                        Debit Transaction may occur on your Northern Star Credit
                        Union debt card through the Star, Pulse, Accel/Exchange,

                        and Plus Networks. Below are examples to distinguish
                        between a Visa Debit and Non-Visa Debit Transactions:
                    </p>

                            a card number in e-commerce or mail/telephone order
                            environments, or swipes the card through a point-of-sale
                            terminal.</li>
                        <li>To initiate a Non-Visa Debt Transaction, the cardholder
                            enters a PIN at the point-of-sale terminal or, for
                            certain bill payment transactions, provides the account
                            number for an e-commerce or mail/telephone after
                            clearly indicating a preference to route it as a
                            Non-Visa Transaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A Non-Visa Debit Transaction will not provide the zero

                        is present, a Non-Visa Transaction may not be an eligible
                        Rewards transaction.&nbsp; Provisions of the cardholder
                        agreement relating only to Visa Transactions are inapplicable
                        to Non-Visa Transactions.
