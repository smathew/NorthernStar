                	<h1>Security Information</h1>
                    <p>Northern Star is committed to making sure that e-Branch
                        is safe and secure. With our security infrastructure
                        in place we are confident that access to your accounts
                        is private and secure. Be sure and check out the <%= link_to "e-Branch FAQ", faq_path %> for other information.</p>
                    <h3>You Play a Role in Security</h3>
                    <p>While Northern Star works to protect your financial privacy,
                        you also play a role in protecting your accounts. There
                        are a number of steps you can take to ensure that your
                        financial experience on the internet is safe and secure.</p>
                    <h3>Ways to Protect Yourself</h3>
                    <ul class="bull">
                        <li>First and foremost, don't reveal your PIN to anyone
                            else. Your PIN is designed to protect the privacy
                            of your account information, but it will only work
                            if you keep it to yourself. If you think your PIN
                            has been compromised, change it immediately online.<br />
                            &nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Don't walk away from your computer if you are in
                            the middle of an e-Branch session.<br />
                            &nbsp;</li>
                        <li>When you are finished using e-Branch, always exit
                            before visiting other Internet sites.<br />
                            &nbsp;</li>
                        <li>If anyone else is likely to use your computer, clear
                            your cache or turn off and re-initiate your browser
                            in order to eliminate copies of web pages that have
                            been stored in your hard drive. How you clear your
                            cache will depend on the browser and version you
                            have. This function is generally found in your preferences
                            menu.<br />
                            &nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Northern Star strongly recommends that you use a
                            browser with 128-bit encryption to conduct secure
                            financial transactions over the Internet. You can
                            download a <%= link_to "Netscape", "http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html", :rel=>"external" %> or <%= link_to "Microsoft", "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/default.asp", :rel=>"external" %> browser that provides the highest level of encryption commercially
                            available.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Browser/Security Encryption</h3>
                    <p>Encryption helps protect your private information so that
                        it cannot be intercepted and read by a third party.<br />
                    <br />
                        Encryption is the scrambling of information for transmission
                        back and forth between two points. A virtual key is required
                        to decode the information. When you request information
                        about your accounts, the request is sent encrypted (scrambled)
                        to Northern Star.<br />
                    <br />
                        We then decode your request for information and send
                        it back to you in an encrypted format. When you receive
                        it, your information is automatically decoded so that
                        you can read it.<br />
                    <br />
                        The encryption technology used by e-Branch is so secure
                        that it is classified by the U.S. Department of Defense
                        and export of this technology to other countries is forbidden
                        by law.<br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Digital Identity</h3>
                    <p>For digital identity verification, we have a digital server
                        certificate that your browser uses each time you sign
                        on to verify that indeed you are connected to Northern
                        Star.</p>
                    <h3>A Note on Cookies</h3>
                    <p> e-Branch utilizes cookies to hold a random session ID
                        each time you log in. This ID is verified each time you
                        send or receive information from e-Branch. The session
                        ID provides security for your private information by
                        responding only to requests that are intended for you.
                        The session cookie is not stored on your computer, and
                        it is dismissed when you exit your browser, or are logged
                        out after the inactivity period. Without accepting this
                        session ID (cookie), you cannot explore your accounts
                        with e-Branch.</p>
